Input:

    gr_utf8.txt from this project https://github.com/iam1980/greeklish-wordlist (also included in the repo). This is probably a very reasonable greek wordlist from a dictionary or something. But because people write lots of stuff that aren't in dictionaries, I added the 2 below sources.
    A rip of the entire site slang.gr, every definition, comment etc, greek words written in the website
    A rip of skroutz.gr reviews like: https://www.skroutz.gr/s/20060269/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black.html#reviews
